# Design Optimization of Paper Gyrocopter

A report on the project can be found [here ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T5cUT9DfobiTlhEeNI7VAJVZoMC7MFrv/view?usp=sharing).

From collected data of the flight time for different paper gyrocopter models, first and second order response functions were estimated for the given design variables. The response functions were maximized to find the set of parameters that make the paper gyrcopter most optimal.
